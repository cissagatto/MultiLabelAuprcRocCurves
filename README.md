# MultiLabel Auprc and Roc Curves

This repository provides code and explanations for computing AUPRC (Area Under the Precision–Recall Curve) and ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves for multilabel classification problems.

📘 Please refer to the file multilabel_auprc_roc.pdf - a detailed tutorial covering the theory and practical implementation of ROC and AUPRC curves in multilabel settings.
